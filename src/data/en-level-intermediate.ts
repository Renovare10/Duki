    body: `The blue coat had been in the shop window for three weeks. Every evening, Eva passed it on her way home. The price was too high for a secondhand coat, even a beautiful one. On Friday, however, a new sign appeared: Half price. Eva went inside before she could change her mind.

At home, she put her hands into the pockets. There was a bus ticket in one and a small envelope in the other. Inside the envelope were two fifty-pound notes. Across the front, someone had written, "For the roof."

Eva laid the money on her kitchen table. The coat had cost thirty pounds. She could certainly use another hundred. Her own roof was fine, but her washing machine had stopped working that morning. For a few minutes, she imagined paying someone to repair it.

Then she called the shop. The assistant said they bought clothes from several different people each week. She would ask her manager about the coat and call back. Eva gave her number, put the money away, and washed her work shirts in the bathroom sink.

Nobody called on Saturday. By Sunday evening, Eva was annoyed. She had expected to feel good about returning the money. Instead, she had a wet floor, sore hands, and a hundred pounds she did not feel free to spend.

On Monday, the manager finally called. An elderly man had brought in the coat after his wife died. The manager still had his telephone number. "Could you leave the envelope with us?" she asked.

Eva hesitated. She wanted to know that the money reached the right person. In the end, the manager arranged for them both to visit the shop on Tuesday.

The man arrived carrying a shopping bag full of old photographs. He showed Eva a picture of his wife wearing the coat beside a seaside hotel. Then he looked at the envelope and laughed, although his eyes were wet.

"She hated that leaking roof," he said. "I told her we couldn't afford the repairs. I suppose she started saving without telling me."

He offered Eva twenty pounds for her trouble. She refused at first, but he pushed it across the counter. "Please. Otherwise I'll have to carry this home as well."

Eva accepted. It paid for a week at the laundry, not a washing machine repair. When she collected her clean shirts, she was still wearing the blue coat. It fitted well, although she now checked both pockets before leaving the house.`,
